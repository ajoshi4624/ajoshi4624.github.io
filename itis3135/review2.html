        <h3>Review</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> The submission does lead to the primary page with links. From here, the client project website is clearly visible in the navbar.</li>
            <li> All files and folders are named correctly; there are no uppercase or spaces within the names</li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Font sizing is sufficient and the contrast is done well, the site is easy to read.</li>
                    <li>b. Page has site colors and fonts via a linked stylesheet</li>
                    <li>c.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Contrast: I really like how the color scheme of this site is very cohesive and complements each other. However I noticed that a large part of the background color is plain white. I would suggest a different shade that is not plain white to add to the design.</li>
                            <li>Repetition: Within each page on the site, the styling of the elements remains consistent which gives the website a polished look.</li>
                            <li>Alignment: I like how the different text of each page are aligned so that they consistent with each other. While the center text alignment works on the nav bar, it makes the body of the text look very busy. I would change the text alignment to the left for the body on the first page </li>
                            <li>Proximity: I like how all the elements on the site are spaced out in a way that gives a clean look to the website. All of the images are relatively the same size and positioned with an equal amount of padding surrounding them.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> The page has a header, main, footer, and nav bar.</li>
            <li> The site does have a brand header on the first page but not on the other pages.</li>
            <li> The main does start with an h2 that doesn't include the brand name</li>
            <li> Each page on the site is missing a brand tagline</li>
            <li> The footer is missing html and css validation links on all other pages except the home page. The user menu is present but not in the footer.</li>
            <li> This page has the specific requirements that are listed in the assignment.</li>
        </ol>
