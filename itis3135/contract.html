            <h2>Pledge</h2>
            <p>I, APOORVA M. JOSHI agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2024, ITIS 3135, WEB
                APP DEVELOPMENT with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. 
            </p>
            <p> I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that
                is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
                may show as absences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible
                to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use
                these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
                (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Apoorva M. Joshi , 09/06/2024
