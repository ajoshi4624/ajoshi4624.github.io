        <h3>Review</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> The submission does lead to the primary page with links, and from here, the client project website is clearly visible in the navbar</li>
            <li> All files and folders are named correctly; there are no uppercase or spaces within the names</li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Font sizing is sufficient and the contrast is done well which makes the site easy to read</li>
                    <li>b. Page has site colors and fonts via a linked stylesheet</li>
                    <li>c.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Contrast: I really like how the color scheme of this site is very cohesive. While the colors are in the same realm, they differ enough to where they complement eachother.</li>
                            <li>Repetition: Within each page on the site, the styling of the elements remains consistent which gives the website a polished look.</li>
                            <li>Alignment: I like how the different boxes on each page are aligned so that they work well with one another. While i like the styling on the nav bar, I think it could be spaced out a bit more evenly so it is aligned among the entire length of the header, instead of being mostly to the left.</li>
                            <li>Proximity: I like how all the elements on the site are spaced out in a way that gives a clean look to the website. The usage of space between the differnt boxes, text, and background is done very nicely.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> The page has a header, main, footer, and nav bar</li>
            <li> The site does have a brand header</li>
            <li> The main does start with an h2 that doesn't include the brand name</li>
            <li> The page is missing a brand tagline</li>
            <li> The footer is missing html and css validation links, the menu for the user's pages are present but it is in the header</li>
            <li> This page has the specific requirements that are listed in the assignment.</li>
        </ol>
