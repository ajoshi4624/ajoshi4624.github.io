                dates, links to buy merch, and an area to sign up for his newsletter</p>
            <ul>Contrast: This website has great contrast between the elements and are very appealing to the eye</ul>
            <ul>Repitition: This website has a very cohesive design, there is repition within the different sections of
                the website as you scroll through</ul>
            <ul>Aligment: The margins and padding on all sides of the website are consistent, and all text is cohesively
                aligned</ul>
            <ul>Proximity: All elements that go well together are grouped together, and are placed very intentionally
            </ul>

                department, upcoming events, and different tabs giving information about the school</p>
            <ul>Contrast: This website is so incredibly chaotic. The colors and fonts do not mesh well together and it
                is very abrasive to the eye.</ul>
            <ul>Repitition: There is no consistency in this website, every element is different and does not go well
                together</ul>

            <ul>Proximity: This site does not have any steady grouping for any of it's elements. Everything is all over
                the place leading to a very difficult browsing experience.</ul>
